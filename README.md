Interactive 3D Spline Animation

# Summary 
This is an interactive 3D shape experience that users can follow with their mouse. For this project, I experimented with Spline to create an experience that would be engaging for the user. 

# About 
For this project, I designed a shape blend with numerous different spheres, layered with materials, that follow the user's cursor. I wanted to keep the experience fun and light-hearted.

# Reflection
This project expanded my horizons in what I can work with in the animation world which I had a lot of fun with! Using Spline, I'm excited to continue to learn about how I can create visually appealing animations and incorporate them into other things I'm working on!
